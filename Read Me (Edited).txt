This website/program is made on the 18th of August 2022 
by Rahmani Dibansa in accordance with the given task of
creating a python program that can recognize faces and gender

Things to note:
1. The main.py is the standalone python program. I 
   made it to test whether the face recognition works.
2. After making sure that the python program is 
   running without any issue, I converted it to flask
3. I had to learn a little bit of flask for this task.
   Fortunately, my foundation in python didn't fail me.
   I was able to learn flask in just a couple of hours.

Problems that I encountered while creating the program:
1. When I ran the website version, I encountered considerable
   lag. I suppose this is due to my laptop's 4GB of RAM.
2. Creating the python program was easy. But converting it
   to Flask was hard since I don't have any prior experience
   in using the Flask framework
3. Website's design. Apparently, I have to create a static folder
   just so Flask could locate my style.css. Troubleshooting
   that problem took a lot of time. I was only able to solve it
   by browsing through stackoverflow.
4. Poor lighting will affect the detection of the eyes.

5. While I was making the second technical exam, I've noticed
   why my website output in the second technical task is lagging.
   I should have placed the faceCascade and eyesCascade in the
   __init__. Furthermore, captureWebcam was duplicated.

How to run the website:
1. Open the app.py and run it.
2. Go to the link address provided when the app runs.

Packages that needs to be installed:
